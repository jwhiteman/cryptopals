ideal:
  keystream is a function, takes a nonce and a counter; client handles incrementing

  text is iterated over byte by byte, no index needed

  keystream bytes are consumed, popped off (keeping w/ the idea of no idx)
  keystream is on-demand, if empty, generate more bytes

  the first (offset % 16) bytes of the keystream are thrown away at the beginning.
